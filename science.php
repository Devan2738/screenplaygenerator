    <p>We will provide a brief explanation of how our website generates screenplays.</p><br>
    <p>Sentences are generally made up of independent and depenedent clauses. A simple tree structure can determine, from a higher level, what clauses a random sentence could consist of.
    Then, each clause can be filled in with the required parts of speech from a database. Setting up coherant adjadenct sentences introduces more complexities, and is perhaps outside
    the realm of possible for this project.</p><br>
    <p>For now, enjoy the nonsense scripts!</p>
